# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-
**1. Understanding Churn:** Define what constitutes churn for your telecom company. Typically, it's when a customer stops using your services or switches to a competitor.

**2. Data Collection:** Gather relevant data such as customer demographics, usage patterns, billing information, customer service interactions, and any other pertinent data points.

**3. Feature Selection:** Identify key features that may influence churn, such as contract length, pricing plans, customer satisfaction scores, network quality, etc.

**4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Cleanse the data to remove outliers, handle missing values, and ensure consistency. Preprocess the data for analysis and modeling.

**5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the data to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that may help understand factors contributing to churn.

**6. Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

**7. Model Training and Evaluation:** Train your chosen models on historical data and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

**8. Feature Importance Analysis:** Determine which features have the most significant impact on churn prediction to understand the drivers behind customer attrition.

**9. Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model into your operational environment to predict churn in real-time or periodically.

**10. Monitoring and Optimization:** Continuously monitor model performance and update it as new data becomes available. Optimize strategies to retain customers based on insights gained from the analysis.
